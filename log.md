# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

1. Fixed styled components to have the popup windows to be positioned in the center.
2. Organized files in my personal website repo to have the correct webpack with necessary modules and frameworks.

**Thoughts:**

For the airbnb clone, I would like to have a deeper understanding on CRUD operations using mysql.
For my personal website, I would like to start designing overall theme and color scheme.
